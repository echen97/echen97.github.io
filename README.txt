I believe that everything has been correctly implemented 

I spent approximately 4 hours on this assignment

NOTE: I was having a lot of problems with my echen97.github.io. I was pushing
relatively consistently, but I ended up having a bunch of errors when I tried
to make my final push. Because I knew that I had to have an echen97.github.io 
page, I deleted the repo and pushed the final project. Here is a general 
order of pushes that I did initially 

1. Pushed index.html 
2. Pushed resume.html and bio.html. 
3. Pushed the css sheet for index.html
4. Pushed the css sheet for resume.html
5. Pushed the css sheet for index.html
6. Pushed this README. 

Thank you for understading!
