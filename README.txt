I created the index.html so that there was a photo of me 
centered, as well as buttons leading to my resume and biography. 

I then created the content for both the resume and biography.

After I had the bare bones (just the text) of the resume, index
and biography, I styled each one with a CSS file. Centering the photos, 
making sure that the text was the size that I wanted, and creating
a background. 



NOTE: I was having a lot of problems with my echen97.github.io. I was pushing
relatively consistently, but I ended up having a bunch of errors when I tried
to make my final push. Because I knew that I had to have an echen97.github.io 
page, I deleted the repo and pushed the final project. Here is a general 
order of pushes that I did initially 

1. Pushed index.html 
2. Pushed resume.html and bio.html. 
3. Pushed the css sheet for index.html
4. Pushed the css sheet for resume.html
5. Pushed the css sheet for index.html
6. Pushed this README. 

Thank you for understading!
